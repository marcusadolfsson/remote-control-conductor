    question: 'Does this send any of my data anywhere?',
    answer:
      'No. The app is local-only and has no analytics, no telemetry, no remote logging. The only outbound request it makes is to check the GitHub Releases manifest for updates.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it really free?',
    answer:
      'Yes, MIT licensed. There is a paid app called Multi-Claude that pioneered the desktop-app half of this approach — ai-profiles extends it to the Claude Code CLI and ships open-source.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I already have Claude or ChatGPT installed?',
    answer:
      'On first launch, ai-profiles asks: (a) keep your existing install separate and start a new profile alongside it (default — press Enter), or (b) migrate your existing install into your first profile. The default leaves your current setup untouched and adds a separate profile reached via claude-<slug> or codex-<slug>. If you choose migrate, the data is copied into the profile dir and the originals are moved to a 7-day backup. You can trigger migration later from Settings → Data → Re-import.',
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'migrate' actually do to my data?",
    answer:
      'Three things, in order: (1) copies the stock app data into the new profile directory under ~/Library/Application Support/ai-profiles/profiles/<id>/ — ~/.claude and ~/Library/Application Support/Claude for a Claude profile, or ~/.codex and ~/Library/Application Support/Codex for a ChatGPT profile; (2) moves the originals into a 7-day backup dir under migration-backup-<timestamp>/; (3) generates the CLI wrapper and launcher (claude-<slug> + Claude (<Name>).app, or codex-<slug> + ChatGPT (<Name>).app). To revert: copy the backup folder contents back to their original locations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it affiliated with Anthropic or OpenAI?',
    answer:
      'No. ai-profiles is an independent project, not affiliated with Anthropic or OpenAI. "Claude" and "Anthropic" are trademarks of Anthropic, PBC. "Codex" and "ChatGPT" are trademarks of OpenAI.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it safe? What about my Keychain credentials?',
    answer:
      'Each profile gets its own Keychain entry, derived from the per-profile config directory. ai-profiles does not read or copy your credentials — Claude Code handles all of that itself. The isolation depends on undocumented Claude Code internals and could break in a future Claude Code release; if it does, we will patch.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I move a session from one account to another?',
    answer:
      "Yes, between profiles of the same app: a Claude Code session to another Claude profile, a Codex session to another ChatGPT profile. You can't move a session from Claude to Codex or back. The move copies the session to the destination and archives it at the source, so you can restore it if you change your mind. Anything the move would overwrite is backed up first. Chats on claude.ai and in ChatGPT live on the server, so they aren't listed.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the per-profile usage card work?',
    answer:
      "Each profile's detail page shows that profile's quota utilization and auto-refreshes every 5 minutes. Claude profiles display three meters (5-hour, 7-day, 7-day Sonnet) by reading the profile's OAuth token from its dedicated Keychain entry and calling Anthropic's /api/oauth/usage endpoint. ChatGPT profiles display two meters (5-hour and weekly) by querying the Codex app-server over its JSON-RPC protocol — no extra auth needed, the app-server handles it via the profile's own auth.json. Both quota endpoints are undocumented internals, so the meters may render as dashes if the response shape changes.",
