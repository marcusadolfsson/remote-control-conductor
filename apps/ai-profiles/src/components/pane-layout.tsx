/**
 * Right-pane chrome: a pinned header over one scrollable content column.
 *
 * The header sits outside the scroll container rather than being
 * `position: sticky` inside it, so it needs no opaque fill to hide content
 * scrolling beneath it — the pane background shows through, and content
 * clips at the header's bottom edge instead.
 *
 * Both rows reserve the scrollbar gutter, so the header column stays aligned
 * with the body column when a classic (non-overlay) scrollbar appears.
 *
 * The bottom padding is deliberately smaller than the top: the last block a
 * pane renders carries its own 24px bottom margin, so 16px here lands the
 * same gutter as the 40px above.
 *
 * With an `aside`, the pane becomes the size container `pane-wide:` queries
 * (see `index.css`). Narrower, the aside follows the body and takes the
 * height left under it, so it can scroll inside itself as it does when wide;
 * it keeps a floor of its own, though, and once the pane is too short for
 * that, the whole column scrolls instead. Wide, the body turns into two
 * equal columns under a header widened to span both: the body column scrolls on
 * its own, reserving its scrollbar gutter as the single column does, and the
 * aside gets the full height to lay out as it likes. The aside is rendered
 * once either way and only CSS moves it, so its state (a half-typed search,
 * say) survives a resize across the breakpoint.
