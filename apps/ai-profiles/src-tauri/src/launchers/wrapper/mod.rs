//! Per-profile wrapper bundles.
//!
//! Several profiles of one app show identical Dock tiles because they all run
//! out of the vendor's bundle, and macOS takes a running app's identity (Dock
//! icon and label, Cmd-Tab entry, menu-bar name) from the bundle its executable
//! lives in. A wrapper is a clone of the vendor app that *becomes* the running
//! app: it has its own bundle id, name and icon, and its executable is the
//! profile shim, which starts the vendor binary (moved to `<exec>.bin`, still
//! inside the wrapper) with the profile's `--user-data-dir`.
//!
//! Building one weakens the app's security: the clone is re-signed ad hoc, its
//! team-scoped entitlements are dropped (the kernel refuses to launch an ad-hoc
//! binary that claims them) and library validation is disabled (the vendor's
//! frameworks are signed by another team than the ad-hoc signature). A wrapper
//! therefore never leaves the machine that built it, and the vendor bundle is
//! only ever read.
