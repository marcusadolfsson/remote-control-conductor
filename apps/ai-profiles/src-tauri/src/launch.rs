//! Starting a desktop app, or a profile of it, exactly once.

//! Claude does NOT enforce one instance per data directory: `open -n` always
//! spawns a brand-new process, and two instances happily share the same
//! `--user-data-dir`. To give each entry (the stock default and every managed
//! profile) "exactly one window, all coexisting" behaviour, we track the
//! running instances ourselves: before launching we scan for a main process
//! already bound to the target data dir, and focus it instead of spawning a
//! duplicate.
//!
//! A profile with a wrapper (see [`crate::launchers::wrapper`]) is opened
//! through it, and never becomes unlaunchable because of it: whatever is wrong
//! with the wrapper, the profile is started the stock way instead and the caller
//! is told why.
