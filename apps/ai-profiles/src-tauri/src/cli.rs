//! The command line, which exists for one caller: a wrapper bundle that found
//! itself out of step with the vendor app it was cloned from.
//!
//! A wrapper cannot rebuild itself. The rebuild deletes and recreates the
//! bundle, and the only process in a position to notice the drift is the shim
//! running out of that very bundle. So it hands the launch back here instead:
//! `ai-profiles --open-profile <id>` opens one profile through the usual route
//! — which rebuilds a stale wrapper on the way — and exits, without ever
//! starting Tauri or showing a window.
//!
//! `ai-profiles mcp` is the other: an MCP server on stdin and stdout, for
//! Claude to manage profiles and sessions with (see [`crate::mcp`]).
