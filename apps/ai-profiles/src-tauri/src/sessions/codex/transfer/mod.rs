//! Moving a Codex session to another profile of the app.
//!
//! A move goes through both homes' app-servers and touches no Codex state db
//! directly: the thread's rollout is copied, as it is, into the destination's
//! `archived_sessions/` under its own name; `thread/unarchive` there makes
//! the destination take it in, putting it back among its sessions; and
//! `thread/archive` at the source archives it there, so Restore undoes the
//! move. A copy the destination wouldn't take is set aside, never removed.
