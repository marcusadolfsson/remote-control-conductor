//! Archiving and restoring a Codex session through app-server.
//!
//! A Codex session is archived or restored through `thread/archive` and
//! `thread/unarchive` on app-server, never by touching the rollout or the
//! state db directly. There is no local record of whether a thread is
//! archived the way Claude's desktop record has `isArchived`, and `thread/list`
//! has no id filter (paging the whole catalog to find one thread is both
//! costly and, without the same `sortKey`/cap as the listing, liable to miss
//! a thread the UI shows), so [`check_with`] and [`apply_with`] both resolve
//! the thread with a single `thread/read` instead: archived state is read off
//! its rollout `path` (under `<config_dir>/archived_sessions/` once archived),
//! and a "thread not loaded" error means the id doesn't exist. Right before
//! the write, [`apply_with`] re-probes the thread's live status, the writer
//! lock and the desktop app again — a live terminal, or the desktop app being
//! quit, may have changed things since the check — and every probe fails
//! *closed*: anything that can't be told apart from "still open" refuses the
//! write rather than risking one under a session that's actually live.
