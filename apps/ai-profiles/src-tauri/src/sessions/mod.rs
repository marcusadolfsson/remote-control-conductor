//! Local coding sessions kept by each profile: Claude Code's and Codex's.
//!
//! A [`Home`] is one place sessions live, a managed profile or an app's stock
//! install ("Default"). The per-app submodules read the sessions a home holds
//! from the apps' own files, which are undocumented internals that can change
//! between versions, so everything here reads leniently and skips what it
//! cannot make sense of rather than failing the whole listing.
