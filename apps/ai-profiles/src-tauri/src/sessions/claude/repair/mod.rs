//! Repairing desktop sessions started before profiles had their own folder.
//!
//! Before profiles pointed their desktop app at their own config dir, a
//! profile's desktop app wrote the transcripts of its Code tab sessions into
//! the stock `~/.claude`. Its records of them stay in the profile's data dir,
//! and the app now looks for their transcripts in the profile's config dir,
//! where they aren't, so it opens them empty. [`check`] finds those sessions
//! and [`apply()`] moves every transcript each one claims (see
//! [`super::ownership`]) into the profile's config dir, at the same path
//! relative to it, bringing the project's memory and the plans the
//! transcripts wrote along. The desktop records are left as they are.
