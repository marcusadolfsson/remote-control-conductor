//! Summaries of Claude Code session transcripts.
//!
//! A transcript is a JSONL file Claude Code appends a record to as the session
//! goes: messages (`user`, `assistant`, `attachment`, `system`, most carrying
//! `timestamp`, `cwd` and `isSidechain`) and metadata (`custom-title`,
//! `ai-title`, `last-prompt`, `relocated`) that is re-appended whenever it
//! changes, so the last record of each kind is the current one. Transcripts
//! reach 100 MB and a config dir holds thousands, and the list is re-read on
//! every window focus: what was read is cached until the file changes, a
//! transcript that grew since is read on from where reading stopped, and only
//! lines that can hold a field read here are decoded at all.
