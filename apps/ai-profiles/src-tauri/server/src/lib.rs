//! remote-control-conductor-server: runs on a Linux machine as the user, and lets the
//! ai-profiles app list that machine's Claude accounts and sessions (and, in
//! later versions, start and resume them in tmux with Remote Control).
//!
//! It speaks HTTPS with a self-signed certificate that clients pin, and each
//! client proves itself with a token it got by pairing. See the README in
//! this folder for setting it up.
